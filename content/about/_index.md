Hi, my name is Xinyu (鑫宇) Zhou (周). Now, I am a third-year PhD student from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, supervised by Prof. Jun Zhao. Before I came to NTU, I received my B.Eng in Computer Science at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in 2020. My research interests include Optimization, Federated Learning, Wireless Communications and Metaverse.
